## Project description
This project consists of a management system for web application security analysis tools.

This system integrates the management of the different tools and offers a common REST API to ease launching, controlling and getting the results of the security analysis of a web application, in a unified way and regardless of the selected tool.

The system is ready to be distributed in a Docker container image, with the aim of making easier its integration in a continuous integration system, and periodically performing security analysis on web applications within the software development cycle.
